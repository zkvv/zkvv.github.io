The three that were not part of the large component were still connected to Robert Catesby in some other, non-familial way; Guy Fawkes was a close childhood and school friend of his, Thomas Bates was his trusted servant, and Sir Everard Digby met him through mutual friend, Jesuit priest Father Garnet.
