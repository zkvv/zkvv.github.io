    <p>The Gunpowder plot is arguable one of the most intriguing political conspiracies and failed assassination attempts in history. 
    The plot first began to take shape in May 1604, when Robert Catesby, disappointed by the failure of King James I in delivering religious tolerance,
     proposed a plan to a group of English Catholics; to blow up the king, as well as the entire House of Lords and House of Commons. 
    The plot was going to be carried out during the State Opening of the England’s Parliament on the 5th of November, 1605, 
    and after a series of uprisings, King James’ nine-year-old daughter, Princess Elizabeth, would be installed as the Catholic head of state.<br />
Around a year later, in March of 1605, the group of conspirators managed to rent a cellar directly underneath the House of Lords. 
    By the time of the Parliaments opening seven months later, the room was filled with three-dozen barrels of gunpowder, guarded by Guy Fawkes.
Fortunately for the Parliament, the plot was exposed to the authorities in an anonymous letter sent by one of the conspirators to Lord Monteagle, warning him not to attend the opening of Parliament. Unsure of the letters meaning, Lord Monteagle immediately gave it to Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury. It is still not known who wrote the letter; most likely Francis Tresham, Monteagle’s brother-in-law, or another conspirator, Thomas Winter, who was well known in Lord Monteagle’s household. Some theorists suggested that someone in the government, even Salisbury himself, had written the letter.
On the evening of November 4t, the Parliament was searched, and Guy Fawkes was found in the basement with the barrels of gunpowder. The next morning, once realizing that the conspiracy had been discovered and Guy Fawkes had been arrested, most of the conspirators fled from London. On November 7, after being moved to and tortured at the Tower of London, Fawkes confessed to the plot. He revealed the list of fellow conspirators, and in the following days, most were either arrested or killed.
In the final project for this class, I will be using social network analysis to examine the groups and individuals associated with the events leading up to November 5th, 1605. Looking and analyzing the networks present will give provide insight as to how the conspirators, as well as the targets, acted in their respective cliques and how these social circles interacted. Using social network analysis, clusters and components can be identified, as well as potential connections between two individuals based on their own connections and influential actors in communities. With these qualitative measurements, quantitative analysis will also be done on the measurements of the closeness, embeddedness of certain important nodes, centrality, clustering coefficient, and density.
In addition to using social network analysis to examine and learn more about the connections between the conspirators and targets, I will also be using it to analyze the conspiracy theory that the gunpowder plot was in fact an “inside job”. The Earl of Salisbury was strongly against Catholics, and theorists believe that he either invented the plot, or allowed it to continue even after the conspiracy had been infiltrated by Parliament agents. Theorists allege that the Earl of Salisbury did this in order to gain the trust and favor of the King, to increase anti-Catholic sentiment in the members of the House of Lords and Parliament, and push for legislation against Catholics. Using social network analysis of another socio-centric network with the additional theoretical ties and an eco-centric network centered on the Earl of Salisbury, I will be able to determine the validity of the claims of connections between the conspirators and the government by the theory, and whether or not an analysis of the centrality, density, triadic closure in the network support the theory.
